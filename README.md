# Stable Diffusion-ESRGAN
# Stable Diffusion + ESRGAN Hybrid Model

**StableDiffusion-ESRGAN** is a hybrid project combining the power of **Stable Diffusion** for AI-based image generation and **ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network)** for high-quality image upscaling. This integration allows users to generate creative, detailed images and enhance them to ultra-high resolutions, maintaining sharpness and clarity. 

## Key Features

- **AI Image Generation**: Leverages Stable Diffusion to create detailed images from text prompts.  
- **High-Resolution Enhancement**: Utilizes ESRGAN to upscale generated images while preserving fine details.  
- **Seamless Integration**: Combines the workflows of Stable Diffusion and ESRGAN for a smooth image generation-to-enhancement pipeline.  
- **Customizable Outputs**: Generate and enhance images for various resolutions and formats.  

## Applications

- Digital art creation  
- Gaming assets and animation  
- High-resolution visual content for printing and media  
- Research and experimentation with AI-driven art  

This repository provides scripts, pre-trained models, and examples for end-to-end image generation and enhancement. Whether you're an artist, developer, or researcher, **StableDiffusion-ESRGAN** offers an innovative way to create and enhance stunning visuals.
